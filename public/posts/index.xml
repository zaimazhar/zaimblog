            <description>Introduction Welcome.
This would be my first ever writing in this blog. Well, then, obviously I owe you an introduction.
My name is Muhammad Zaim, you can just call me Zaim for short.
A lean guy with average height of Malaysian men. I was born on the 90s, grew in Malaysia and codes a lot.
Career Early in my career, I was thought of working in the semiconductor industry. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t care less since I&amp;rsquo;m kinda working in some areas that actually included semiconductor (The CPU I used for programming for example).</description>

<p>Welcome.</p>
<p>This would be my first ever writing in this blog. Well, then, obviously I owe you an introduction.</p>
<p>My name is <strong>Muhammad Zaim</strong>, you can just call me <strong>Zaim</strong> for short.</p>
<p>A lean guy with average height of Malaysian men. I was born on the 90s, grew in Malaysia and codes a lot.</p>
<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<p>Early in my career, I was thought of working in the semiconductor industry. I couldn&rsquo;t care less since I&rsquo;m kinda working in some areas that actually included semiconductor (The CPU I used for programming for example).</p>
<p>I was yearning to work for companies like Intel or Celestica, because both are near to my hometown.</p>
<p>I took Computer Engineering course during my endeavours, that explained why I keep bragging about getting into the semiconductor industry from the start.</p>
<p>As I progress into the course, I found myself to be fond with software technologies. When I started learning about databases and Linux distributions during my studies, the topics was deeply immersed inside my head.</p>
<p>A more software-related courses ensued and I am keen to land a job doing software development. That&rsquo;s the summary of how I was so intrigued about softwares.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do-exactly">What I Do Exactly?</h2>
<p>I do <em>programming</em> and stuff, particularly on <em>website development</em>. I found website as a piece of software that transcends across different devices and machines.</p>
<p>Making good and useful softwares have always been my priority and will always put me on shaky position if I could not deliver one.</p>
<p>I am also an <em>advocate of programming best practices</em>, simply means I will not take it lightly if I couldn&rsquo;t understand the code that I write without any further and thorough explanation about it.</p>
<p>Most of the time, I deal with PHP code and you could say I am familiar with the <strong>$$$</strong> üòé.</p>
<h2 id="past-works">Past Works</h2>
<p>I have done quite a number of projects in the past, you can check my <a href="https://github.com/zaimazhar">GitHub</a> account to check some of them.</p>
<p>Most of my monetary related projects are private, there could be nothing much expectation from freelancing projects. It is understandable, no business wants their competitors to get a look into their source code anyway.</p>
<h2 id="last-words">Last Words</h2>
<p>I appreciate if you made it to here, I am thankful with the journey I have went through from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic up to this point of my life. I have always stepped on the right rocks since, from meeting one random person to collaborate on a startup, to meeting a group of other developers, making money along the way, until I have landed a job as a software engineer.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t express the surreal feeling, it&rsquo;s like the path was paved little by little by Allah to make my life better by each day ü§≤. I went through much, happy, sad, depress, everything.</p>
<p>I have met a lot of amazing people, and I want to apologize to any of them if I ever hurt them in any form. üôè</p>
<p>I have nothing left to say, I&rsquo;ll left it on here and continue my writing later.</p>
